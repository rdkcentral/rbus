/**
 * @mainpage RDK Bus (RBus)
 * RDK Bus (RBus) is a lightweight, fast and efficient bus messaging system. 
 * It allows interprocess communication (IPC) and remote procedure call (RPC)
 * between multiple process running on a hardware device.  It supports the
 * creation and use of a data model, which is a hierarchical tree of named 
 * objects with properties, events, and methods.
 *
 * From a developer perspective, there are providers and clients.
 * Providers implement the data model which clients consume.
 *
 * Providers perform these tasks:
 *  - register properties and implement their get and set operations
 *  - register object and implement their get, set, create, and delete operations
 *  - register and plublish events
 *  - register and implement methods which can be called remotely
 *
 * Consumers perform these tasks:
 *  - get and set property values.
 *  - get, set, create, and delete objects.
 *  - subscribe and listen to events
 *  - invoke remote methods
 *
 * A process can be both a provider and a client.  A process can implement many properties,
 * objects, events, and remote methods, and also be a client of the same coming from other providers.
 *
 * All objects, properties, events, and methods are assigned names by the provider.
 * Each name should be unique across a system, otherwise there will be conflicts in the bus routing.
 *
 * RBus supports the naming convention defined by TR-069, where a name has a hierarchical structure
 * like a file directory structure, with each level of the hierarchy separated by a dot ('.'), and where
 * object instances and denoted using brace({}).
 * 
 * The RBus API is intended, but not limited, to allow the implementation of a TR-181 data model.

 *      paramCount      : 1                                                   \n
